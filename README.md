### About :new:
The possibilities of managing economy and especially budgets is a very common concern among many. The availabilities of management-tools which is ranging from simple to advanced features. However, in this project I am taking on the task of simplifying this process, users who are fresh into startups have a lot to digest, with my *Budget Manager* I'll release a tool that convenient and basic it can reduce your work load, rather than complicating it. Whenever you feel ready to move onto other management-tools or feel like there is missing features, please feel free to contact me, and I'll do my very best to help!

### Mobility :briefcase: :computer: :iphone:
If you are working from an office, your living room, on a desktop or a tablet - it should feel the same and be a problem-free process. Therefore I am focusing on the responsiveness and mobility across platforms and devices. 

### Availability 
To apply with the meaning behind my *Budget Manager* the availability will be as broad as possible. Hosting it online (responsive for all platforms), writing it in a mobile application and launch on the official Google Play Store (Working with publishing to AppStore).
